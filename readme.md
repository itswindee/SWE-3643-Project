# KSU SWE 3643 Software Testing and Quality Assurance Semester Project: Web-Based Calculator
This project is working on a web-based calculator app programmed in Python by using Flask, an extensible web framework for Python. Flask provides tools, libraries, and patterns to help developers build web applications quickly and efficiently. After the calculator functions are properly working, this program will be tested in Pytest.

## Architecture

## Environment
This application is currently being tested in Windows and upon completion, we will introduce this to Mac.

To prepare your environment to execute this application:
**Install the latest version of Python for your device.** Currently, this application is using Python 3.12.0.
- [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [macOs](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
<br><br>

(NOTE: macOs usually comes with Python pre-installed, but you can download the latest versio of Python using the link.)


## Executing the Web Application
This application is being tested using the JetBrains PyCharm IDEA. If you do not have PyCharm installed, here is the [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows) to the download: 

Once you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and PyCharm installed, you can install Flask using 'pip' - Python's package manager.

   Open a terminal or command prompt. Run the following command to install Flask: 

   ```
      pip install Flask
   ```

   You can verify that Flask has installed properly by running this command to check its version:
    
   ```
      flask --version
   ```
    
   To view the Flask application, run the program. You should see a warning message similar to this:

   Click on the URL shown and it will prompt a pop-up on your screen to view the Flask application.

## Executing Unit Tests

**Configuring Pytest for unit tests:**

    Install Pytest if you don't have it yet. Run the following command in your command line (terminal/console):
    ```
        pip install -U pytest
    ```
    Make sure you have the correct version installed.
    ```
        $ pytest --version
    ```
